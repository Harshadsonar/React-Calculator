Project Overview
Objective

The objective is to create a simple React calculator that uses React Hooks, specifically the useState hook.
Task

    The first step is to take two inputs from the user. These inputs will represent the two numbers that will be used in the calculations. The input fields should be of type "text" and not "number."
    Next, create four buttons for the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    When each button is clicked, two functions should be called. The first function will be for validation, which will check if the input fields are not empty and if the numbers entered are either integers, floating-point numbers, positive, or negative. The second function will perform the operation and set the result using the useState hook.
    If the validation fails, a red error message should be displayed, as shown in the second screen of the Figma file. This error message should be handled using the useState hook as well.
    If the result is shown, a green success message should be displayed along with the result, and the state of the result should be updated and shown on the screen.
    Overall, the goal of the contest is to create a functional React calculator that makes use of the useState hook and properly handles input validation and displaying results.
